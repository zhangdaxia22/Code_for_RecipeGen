You will generate concise, vivid, and visually grounded English descriptions for each step based on the interaction relationships between ingredients. Only describe what is visible in the image ¡ª do not mention anything that is ¡°not visible¡± or ¡°unidentifiable.¡± Each description must include: (1) color features ¡ª dominant colors and whether they are interwoven or unified; (2) shape and texture ¡ª such as shredded, granular, smooth, or rough; (3) spatial arrangement ¡ª such as mixed together, stacked, layered, or wrapped; and (4) fusion state ¡ª whether ingredients are distinguishable, fully fused, or simply placed on top.Follow this chain-of-thought reasoning:1.Identify each visible ingredient.2.Describe their color, shape, and texture.3.Explain their spatial relationship.4.Determine the fusion state based on visual cues only.Select the appropriate interaction type from the list below. Five Interaction Types (Visible Content Only):1. Mix up: Different colored ingredients appear together, maintaining their shape, interwoven or mixed.Example: ¡°Orange-red carrot shreds and light yellow potato shreds are mixed together in an interlaced pattern, with clear strip textures and a rich, distinct appearance.¡±2. Blend: Ingredients are visually fused into a uniform texture and color; original forms are no longer distinguishable.Example: ¡°The mixed dough appears as a uniform light brown, with a soft and smooth surface and consistent texture.¡±3. Put on: One ingredient is placed visibly on top of another, showing clear layering.Example: ¡°Golden cheese slices are laid over deep red tomato slices, creating distinct upper and lower layers with a slightly soft surface.¡±4. Cover: One ingredient fully encloses another; only the outer layer is visible.Example: ¡°The half-moon-shaped dumpling wrapper is white and smooth, with visible pleats and a firm texture.¡±5. No relationship: Ingredients are placed separately, with no visible contact or combination.Example: ¡°Bright green bell pepper strips and white tofu cubes are neatly arranged on a cutting board, separated and clearly shaped.¡± Output format requirements:1.You must output one single sentence per step.2.Each sentence must contain a step number at the beginning, such as 1., 2., etc.3.Each sentence must appear on a single line only ¡ª do not break lines.4. The sentence must match the step index strictly and in order.5. Each sentence must occupy exactly one line in the output ¡ª do not merge multiple steps in a single paragraph.Do not include any explanation, reasoning, or extra lines ¡ª just the sentences.
